# MTConnect Status Update

We are using MTConnect to update the status of an Ultra-precision CNC machine - FANUC ROBONANO $\alpha$-0*i*B. The machine information can be found at the [Smart Manufacturing Website](https://smartmfg.me.wisc.edu/pages/dashboards/machine_monitoring/robonano1_ms.html) from MINLab.

## Highlights
- The adapter was cloned from the official MTConnect repository and augmented
- FOCAS2 was used to interface with the FANUC Controller
- The adapter and the agent were deployed on Raspberry Pis
- MQTT protocol was used to transfer data from the agent to the cloud (AWS)
  - Topics for data and params
  - Topics for Device Shadow updates
- By visiting the website, the data upload is initiated by clicking on the "Connect to Machine" button
